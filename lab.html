This in-vitro “dynamic” human GI model enables researchers to suitably investigate fate of the orally given therapeutic and other formulations. In this, model, each of the six reactors represents distinct parts of the human GI system (reactors 1-6): the stomach, the duodenum, the small intestine, the ascending colon, the transverse colon and the descending colon. This in-vitro GI model smartly mimics human GI conditions with regard to pH, bacteria, enzymes, volume, food retention time, food mixing, food therapeutic formulation and particles interactions and others.</div>
